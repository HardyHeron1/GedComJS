Package PEAR2_Genealogy_Gedcom summary.

This package supports reading of a standard GEDCOM 5.5.1 compliant file
and parsing that file into an object tree.  Fields can then be navigated
using standard object references.

It also supports writing as GEDCOM 5.5.1 compliant file though it DOES NOT
guarantee that the file created will be identical in every way to the
original, only that it will be compliant.
